            <p class="showcase-subtitel">The Groninger Landschap is a foundation that focuses on landscape, heritage and culture in the province of Groningen. For the maintenance of this, they have donors, also called protectors. Furthermore, they work with a small permanent team and a large team of volunteers. The Groninger Landschap sees that young people between the ages of 12 and 22 are not very involved with the foundation and would like to see this change.</p>

    <h2 class="inside-titel"> Case</h2>
    <p>Hhe goal of the Groningen landscape is to initially involve young people more in nature and the environment. A goal in the distant future would be that this group, when they are older, will register as protectors. They would like to see an interactive solution that involves young people between the ages of 12 and 22 in the Groningen landscape.</p>

<div class="container fluid portfolio-inside">
    <h2 class="inside-titel"> Process</h2>
    <p>Based on the case and the conversation with the client, we entered a concept phase. This means that we held a brainstorming session in which we all came up with spontaneous ideas that could possibly appeal to the target group. We also looked at existing applications such as Meetup. In this, people can join a group and then undertake activities together. We also knew that Pokémon Go was a big hit and that the whole world suddenly went outdoors. In addition, an idea came up to develop an application that contained all kinds of events. Also for the new target group, because this did not exist yet.
        <br><br>

        After these initial ideas, we conducted more extensive research into the Groningen landscape, the target group, storytelling, gamification and laws & regulations. We conducted the research into the Groninger Landschap to see which activities they already offer, how they currently do this and who they do and do not reach with this. These activities were mainly aimed at children up to 12 years old and the elderly. In addition, they do share routes but do not play into this. We also noticed that they do not offer anything between these ages. We conducted research into gamification because the goal of our product is to bring about behavioral change in young people. The research into laws & regulations came from Het Groninger Landschap. They indicated that it is important to take this into account in order to clearly map out your own liability and the rules for users. The results of the research resulted in several points that together should ensure that the target group is made enthusiastic to download the application. It is therefore important that there is a way of progress and challenge in an application, that a form of collaboration is possible, and that information about the environment is acquired at the same time.
 <br><br>
 The survey showed that most young people like to go for a walk and prefer to do this in groups. They also seem to enjoy participating in outdoor activities. This is good news for us and the Groninger Landschap, because it shows that young people do not find walking boring. Furthermore, it showed that most young people are busy with their phones and more than half also play games on them. A large part of the users would probably be motivated by an app in the form of a game to go outside. These results showed that an interactive app could indeed motivate young people to go for a walk outside. In addition, we also held an interview with the client. This showed that the Groninger Landschap would like us to incorporate their current house style into the interactive app. We did this by using their colours: blue and white, their font and capitals. We did choose to add a green colour to this. We did this because the green colour radiates nature.

    <h2 class="inside-titel"> Prototype</h2>
    <p>We started building the prototype in HTML/CSS. Everyone started building their own designed pages. We used Github to pull and check each other's code. A group member already had knowledge of making pages dynamic using MySQL and had already made a start. Because there was time left, I decided to try to make the group pages dynamic. With help from the group, this was also successful. This introduced me to MySQL.</p>

    <h2 class="inside-titel"> Reflection</h2>
    <p>In the end, we got a large part of the prototype working. Many parts are really usable. I also learned a lot about using PHP, and I gained more insight into how to program. Unfortunately, not everything was finished. For example, the lines are not always neat. We ultimately decided not to adjust this at the last minute because we did not want to break anything and it was no longer a priority for us when it comes to the user experience. Furthermore, I learned to work with GIThub during this project. This was very useful for us because it allowed us to all work in the same document at the same time. I did notice that it is important to keep an eye on whether you have to push or pull something, because otherwise errors will occur. It is also important to describe clearly what you are actually pushing. In addition, I learned how to make certain parts dynamic and I worked a little bit with MySQL for the first time.
